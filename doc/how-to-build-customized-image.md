![Fork Base repo](/doc/media/fork-base-repo.png)

2.	In your forked repository, change the value in gallery.yml:

name: "the gallery name that we just created in the above step"
resourceGroup: "the resource group that the gallery is located"

Please check the mapping as below:

## Create Service Principal

1.	Create a Service Principal with the Azure CLI command as below:

az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription id>  -n <your  service principal name>

You will get the output as below:
{
  "clientId": "<GUID>",
  "clientSecret": "<STRING>",
  "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
  "tenantId": "<GUID>"
  (...)
}

Remove all the line breaks and keep a single link as below:
{ "clientId": "<GUID>", "clientSecret": "<GUID>", "subscriptionId": "<GUID>", "tenantId": "<GUID>", (...) }

2.	Go to the settings of your forked GitHub project

3.	Click "Secrets" -> "Actions" -> "New Repository Secret"
![New Repository Secret](/doc/media/new-repo-secret.png)

Secret name is "AZURE_CREDENTIALS". Value is the single line that we prepared before as below:
{ "clientId": "<GUID>", "clientSecret": "<GUID>", "subscriptionId": "<GUID>", "tenantId": "<GUID>", (...) }

## Generate the image
1.	Go to the forked GitHub projectâ€™s "Actions" page
![GitHub Actions](/doc/media/github-actions.png)

Enable it if there is an option asking to click.

2.	Define the software to install
Go to images/VSCodeBox/build.pkr.hcl
If the software can be installed by choco, just execute the command "choco install" to install.
Note: --confirm is required otherwise, it will be installed by confirm yes or no.
If the software cannot be installed by choco, please write up the related PowerShell script to install the specific software.
